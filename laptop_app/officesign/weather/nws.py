"""Weather for Burlington, MA via the free, no-API-key National Weather
Service API.

server/server.py's existing code hardcodes the forecast gridpoint
(BOX/54,48); that value has since gone stale -- NWS re-grids office coverage
over time, and it now 404s. We instead resolve the current gridpoint at
request time via the /points/{lat},{lon} endpoint, so this can't silently
go stale the same way.

The /forecast endpoint only gives period forecasts (today/tonight/etc), no
live observation -- so "current temperature" there would just duplicate the
day's forecast high, which is wrong outside midday. We instead pull a true
current reading from the nearest observation station (KBED, Hanscom Field)
and keep /forecast only for the high/low.
