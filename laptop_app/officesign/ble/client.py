"""BLE client for the OfficeSign, built on bleak (asyncio, CoreBluetooth on
macOS). Finds the sign by its advertised service UUID rather than by name or
MAC address, and writes messages to its single control characteristic.

This class only manages a single connection attempt/session; it does not
retry on its own. Staying connected across drops (laptop sleep, walking out
of BLE range, the sign power-cycling) is the reconnector's job -- see
ble/reconnector.py -- so that callers who just want to fire a message off
(the web routes) don't need to know anything about retry policy.
